ExecJS Error while running new RoR project.
---------------------------
If you are running in WIndows, the coffee-script-source 1.9.0 does not work on windows.

Change it to a previous version adding this line to your Gemfile:

gem 'coffee-script-source', '1.8.0'

And then reinstall the bundle adjusting the dependencies for the new Gem version with:

bundle update coffee-script-source

and then restart the server
